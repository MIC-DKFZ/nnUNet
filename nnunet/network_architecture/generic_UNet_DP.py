        As opposed to the Generic_UNet, this class will compute parts of the loss function in the forward pass. This is
        useful for GPU parallelization. The batch DICE loss, if used, must be computed over the whole batch. Therefore, in a
        naive implementation, all softmax outputs must be copied to a single GPU which will then
        do the loss computation all by itself. In the context of 3D Segmentation, this results in a lot of overhead AND
        is inefficient because the DICE computation is also kinda expensive (Think 8 GPUs with a result of shape
        2x4x128x128x128 each.). The DICE is a global metric, but its parts can be computed locally (TP, FP, FN). Thus,
        this implementation will compute all the parts of the loss function in the forward pass (and thus in a
        parallelized way). The results are very small (batch_size x num_classes for TP, FN and FP, respectively; scalar for CE) and
        copied easily. Also the final steps of the loss function (computing batch dice and average CE values) are easy
        and very quick on the one GPU they need to run on. BAM.
        final_nonlin is lambda x:x here!
