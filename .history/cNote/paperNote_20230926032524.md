## 摘要

U-Net是2015年提出的。由于其直接的成功架构，它很快就成为医学图像分割中常用的基准。然而，U-Net对新问题的适应包含了关于精确架构、预处理、训练和推理的几个自由度。这些选择彼此不独立，并且对整体性能和泛化能力有着重大影响。本文介绍了nnU-Net（“no-new-Net”），它是基于2D和3D香草U-Net的稳健和自适应框架。我们认为，许多提出的网络设计的超级钟和哨声是多余的，而是专注于剩余的方面，这些方面构成了方法的性能和泛化能力。我们在医学分割十项全能挑战赛的背景下评估了nnU-Net，该挑战赛衡量了十个学科中的分割性能，包括不同的实体、图像模态、图像几何和数据集大小，不允许数据集之间的手动调整。在提交稿时，nnU-Net在挑战的在线排行榜中实现了所有类别和七个阶段1任务（除了BrainTumour中的类别1）的最高平均骰子分数。

医学图像分割目前由深度卷积神经网络（CNN）主导。然而，每个分割基准似乎都需要专门的架构和训练方案修改才能实现竞争性能。这导致了该领域大量的出版物，这些出版物除了在有限的验证上进行了有限的验证之外，还使得研究人员越来越难以确定方法是否能够实现他们承诺的优越性，超出了他们所展示的有限的场景。医学分割十项全能赛旨在专门解决这个问题：参与者被要求创建一个分割算法，该算法可以横跨10个数据集，对应于人体的不同实体。这些算法可以动态地适应特定数据集的特定性，但只能以完全自动的方式进行。挑战分为两个连续的阶段：1）开发阶段，在该阶段，参与者可以访问7个数据集，以优化其方法，并使用其最终的冻结方法，必须提交相应的7个保留测试集的分割。2）第二阶段在此阶段，对3个先前未公开的数据集评估相同的确切方法。

Abstract. The U-Net was presented in 2015. With its straight-forward
and successful architecture it quickly evolved to a commonly used benchmark in medical image segmentation. The adaptation of the U-Net to
novel problems, however, comprises several degrees of freedom regarding the exact architecture, pre-processing, training and inference. These
choices are not independent of each other and substantially impact the
overall performance. The present paper introduces the nnU-Net (”nonew-Net”), which refers to a robust and self-adapting framework on the
basis of 2D and 3D vanilla U-Nets. We argue the strong case for taking
away superfluous bells and whistles of many proposed network designs
and instead focus on the remaining aspects that make out the performance and generalizability of a method. We evaluate the nnU-Net in the
context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge, which measures segmentation performance in ten disciplines comprising distinct
entities, image modalities, image geometries and dataset sizes, with no
manual adjustments between datasets allowed. At the time of manuscript
submission, nnU-Net achieves the highest mean dice scores across all
classes and seven phase 1 tasks (except class 1 in BrainTumour) in the
online leaderboard of the challenge.

1 Introduction
Medical Image Segmentation is currently dominated by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, each segmentation benchmark seems to require
specialized architectures and training scheme modifications to achieve competitive performance [1,2,3,4,5]. This results in huge amounts of publications in the
field that, alongside often limited validation on only few or even just a single
dataset, make it increasingly difficult for researchers to identify methods that live
up to their promised superiority beyond the limited scenarios they are demonstrated on. The Medical Segmentation Decathlon is intended to specifically address this issue: participants in this challenge are asked to create a segmentation
algorithm that generalizes across 10 datasets corresponding to different entities
arXiv:1809.10486v1 [cs.CV] 27 Sep 2018
of the human body. These algorithms may dynamically adapt to the specifics
of a particular dataset, but are only allowed to do so in a fully automatic manner. The challenge is split into two successive phases: 1) a development phase in
which participants are given access to 7 datasets to optimize their approach on
and, using their final and thus frozen method, must submit segmentations for
the corresponding 7 held-out test sets. 2) a second phase to evaluate the same
exact method on 3 previously undisclosed datasets.
We hypothesize that some of the architectural modifications presented recently are in part overfitted to specific problems or could suffer from imperfect
validation that results from sub-optimal reimplementations of the state-of-theart. Using the U-Net as a benchmark on an in-house dataset, for example, requires the adaptation of the method to the novel problem. This spans several
degrees of freedom. Even though the architecture itself is quite straight-forward,
and even though the method is quite commonly used as a benchmark, we believe
that the remaining interdependent choices regarding the exact architecture, preprocessing, training, inference and post-processing quite often cause the U-Net
to underperform when used as a benchmark. Additionally, architectural tweaks
that are intended to improve the performance of a network can rather easily
be demonstrated to work if the network is not yet fully optimized for the task
at hand, allowing for plenty of headroom for the tweak to improve results. In
our own preliminary experiments, these tweaks however were unable to improve
segmentation results in fully optimized networks and thus most likely unable
to advance the state of the art. This leads us to believe that the influence of
non-architectural aspects in segmentation methods is much more impactful, but
at the same time also severely underestimated.
In this paper, we present the nnU-Net (”no-new-Net”) framework. It resides
on a set of three comparatively simple U-Net models that contain only minor
modifications to the original U-Net [6]. We omit recently proposed extensions
such as for example the use of residual connections [7,8], dense connections [5] or
attention mechanisms [4]. The nnU-Net automatically adapts its architectures
to the given image geometry. More importantly though, the nnU-Net framework
thoroughly defines all the other steps around them. These are steps where much
of the nets’ performance can be gained or respectively lost: preprocessing (e.g.
resampling and normalization), training (e.g. loss, optimizer setting and data
augmentation), inference (e.g. patch-based strategy and ensembling across testtime augmentations and models) and a potential post-processing (e.g. enforcing
single connected components if applicable).
2 Methods
2.1 Network architectures
Medical images commonly encompass a third dimension, which is why we consider a pool of basic U-Net architectures consisting of a 2D U-Net, a 3D U-Net
and a U-Net Cascade. While the 2D and 3D U-Nets generate segmentations
at full resolution, the cascade first generates low resolution segmentations and
subsequently refines them. Our architectural modifications as compared to the
U-Net’s original formulation are close to negligible and instead we focus our
efforts on designing an automatic training pipeline for these models.
The U-Net [6] is a successful encoder-decoder network that has received a lot
of attention in the recent years. Its encoder part works similarly to a traditional
classification CNN in that it successively aggregates semantic information at the
expense of reduced spatial information. Since in segmentation, both semantic as
well as spatial information are crucial for the success of a network, the missing
spatial information must somehow be recovered. The U-Net does this through
the decoder, which receives semantic information from the bottom of the ’U’
and recombines it with higher resolution feature maps obtained directly from
the encoder through skip connections. Unlike other segmentation networks, such
as FCN [9] and previous iterations of DeepLab [10] this allows the U-Net to
segment fine structures particularly well.
Just like the original U-Net, we use two plain convolutional layers between
poolings in the encoder and transposed convolution operations in the decoder.
We deviate from the original architecture in that we replace ReLU activation
functions with leaky ReLUs (neg. slope 1e
−2
) and use instance normalization [11]
instead of the more popular batch normalization [12].
2D U-Net Intuitively, using a 2D U-Net in the context of 3D medical image segmentation appears to be suboptimal because valuable information along
the z-axis cannot be aggregated and taken into consideration. However, there
is evidence [13] that conventional 3D segmentation methods deteriorate in performance if the dataset is anisotropic (cf. Prostate dataset of the Decathlon
challenge).
3D U-Net A 3D U-Net seems like the appropriate method of choice for 3D
image data. In an ideal world, we would train such an architecture on the entire
patient’s image. In reality however, we are limited by the amount of available
GPU memory which allows us to train this architecture only on image patches.
While this is not a problem for datasets comprised of smaller images (in terms
of number of voxels per patient) such as the Brain Tumour, Hippocampus and
Prostate datasets of this challenge, patch-based training, as dictated by datasets
with large images such as Liver, may impede training. This is due to the limited
field of view of the architecture which thus cannot collect sufficient contextual
information to e.g. correctly distinguish parts of a liver from parts of other
organs.
U-Net Cascade To address this practical shortcoming of a 3D U-Net on
datasets with large image sizes, we additionally propose a cascaded model. Therefore, a 3D U-Net is first trained on downsampled images (stage 1). The segmentation results of this U-Net are then upsampled to the original voxel spacing and
passed as additional (one hot encoded) input channels to a second 3D U-Net,
which is trained on patches at full resolution (stage 2). See Figure 1.

Stage 2 (right): these segmentations are concatenated as one-hot encodings to the full resolution data and refined by a second 3D U-Net.
Dynamic adaptation of network topologies Due to the large differences
in image size (median shape 482 × 512 × 512 for Liver vs. 36 × 50 × 35 for
Hippocampus) the input patch size and number of pooling operations per axis
(and thus implicitly the number of convolutional layers) must be automatically
adapted for each dataset to allow for adequate aggregation of spatial information.
Apart from adapting to the image geometries, there are technical constraints like
the available memory to account for. Our guiding principle in this respect is to
dynamically trade off the batch-size versus the network capacity, presented in
detail below:
We start out with network configurations that we know to be working with
our hardware setup. For the 2D U-Net this configuration is an input patch size of
256×256, a batch size of 42 and 30 feature maps in the highest layers (number of
feature maps doubles with each downsampling). We automatically adapt these
parameters to the median plane size of each dataset (where we use the plane
with the lowest in-plane spacing, corresponding to the highest resolution), so
that the network effectively trains on entire slices. We configure the networks to
pool along each axis until the feature map size for that axis is smaller than 8 (but
not more than a maximum of 6 pooling operations). Just like the 2D U-Net, our
3D U-Net uses 30 feature maps at the highest resolution layers. Here we start
with a base configuration of input patch size 128 × 128 × 128, and a batch size
of 2. Due to memory constraints, we do not increase the input patch volume
beyond 1283 voxels, but instead match the aspect ratio of the input patch size
to that of the median size of the dataset in voxels. If the median shape of the
dataset is smaller than 1283
then we use the median shape as input patch size
and increase the batch size (so that the total number of voxels processed is the
same as with 128 × 128 × 128 and a batch size of 2). Just like for the 2D U-Net
we pool (for a maximum of 5 times) along each axis until the feature maps have
size 8.
For any network we limit the total number of voxels processed per optimizer
step (defined as the input patch volume times the batch size) to a maximum of

5% of the dataset. For cases in excess, we reduce the batch size (with a lowerbound of 2).
All network topologies generated for the phase 1 datasets are presented in
table 2.1.
2.2 Preprocessing
The preprocessing is part of the fully automated segmentation pipeline that
our method consists of and, as such, the steps presented below are carried out
without any user intervention.
Cropping All data is cropped to the region of nonzero values. This has no effect
on most datasets such as liver CT, but will reduce the size (and therefore the
computational burden) of skull stripped brain MRI.
Resampling CNNs do not natively understand voxel spacings. In medical images, it is common for different scanners or different acquisition protocols to
result in datasets with heterogeneous voxel spacings. To enable our networks
to properly learn spatial semantics, all patients are resampled to the median
voxel spacing of their respective dataset, where third order spline interpolation
is used for image data and nearest neighbor interpolation for the corresponding
segmentation mask.
Necessity for the U-Net Cascade is determined by the following heuristics:
If the median shape of the resampled data has more than 4 times the voxels
that can be processed as input patch by the 3D U-Net (with a batch size of
2), it qualifies for the U-Net Cascade and this dataset is additionally resampled
to a lower resolution. This is done by increasing the voxel spacing (decrease
resolution) by a factor of 2 until the above mentioned criterion is met. If the
dataset is anisotropic, the higher resolution axes are first downsampled until
they match the low resolution axis/axes and only then all axes are downsampled
simultaneously. The following datasets of phase 1 fall within the set of described
heuristics and hence trigger usage of the U-Net Cascade: Heart, Liver, Lung,
and Pancreas.
Normalization Because the intensity scale of CT scans is absolute, all CT
images are automatically normalized based on statistics of the entire respective
dataset: If the modality description in a dataset’s corresponding json desccriptor
file indicates ‘ct’, all intensity values occurring within the segmentation masks
of the training dataset are collected and the entire dataset is normalized by
clipping to the [0.5, 99.5] percentiles of these intensity values, followed by a zscore normalization based on the mean and standard deviation of all collected
intensity values. For MRI or other image modalities (i.e. if no ‘ct’ string is
found in the modality), simple z-score normalization is applied to the patient
individually.
If cropping reduces the average size of patients in a dataset (in voxels) by
1/4 or more the normalization is carried out only within the mask of nonzero
elements and all values outside the mask are set to 0.
2.3 Training Procedure
All models are trained from scratch and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation
on the training set. We train our networks with a combination of dice and crossentropy loss:
Ltotal = Ldice + LCE (1)
For 3D U-Nets operating on nearly entire patients (first stage of the U-Net
Cascade and 3D U-Net if no cascade is necessary) we compute the dice loss for
each sample in the batch and average over the batch. For all other networks we
interpret the samples in the batch as a pseudo-volume and compute the dice loss
over all voxels in the batch.
The dice loss formulation used here is a multi-class adaptation of the variant
proposed in [14]. Based on past experience [13,1] we favor this formulation over
other variants [8,15]. The dice loss is implemented as follows:
Ldc = −
2
|K|

k∈K
P
i∈I
u
k
i
v
k
P
i
i∈I
u
k
i +
P
i∈I
v

(2)
where u is the softmax output of the network and v is a one hot encoding
of the ground truth segmentation map. Both u and v have shape I × K with
i ∈ I being the number of pixels in the training patch/batch and k ∈ K being
the classes.
We use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 3 × 10−4
for
all experiments. We define an epoch as the iteration over 250 training batches.
During training, we keep an exponential moving average of the validation (l
v
MA)
and training (l
t
MA) losses. Whenever l
t
MA did not improve by at least 5 × 10−3
within the last 30 epochs, the learning rate was reduced by factor 5. The training
was terminated automatically if l
v
MA did not improve by more than 5 × 10−3
within the last 60 epochs, but not before the learning rate was smaller than
10−6
.
Data Augmentation When training large neural networks from limited training data, special care has to be taken to prevent overfitting. We address this problem by utilizing a large variety of data augmentation techniques. The following
augmentation techniques were applied on the fly during training: random rotations, random scaling, random elastic deformations, gamma correction augmentation and mirroring. Data augmentation was done with our own in-house framework which is publically available at github.com/MIC-DKFZ/batchgenerators.
We define sets of data augmentation parameters for the 2D and 3D U-Net
separately. These parameters are not modified between datasets.
Applying three dimensional data augmentation may be suboptimal if the
maximum edge length of the input patch size of a 3D U-Net is more than two
times as large as the shortest. For datasets where this criterion applies we use
our 2D data augmentation instead and apply it slice-wise for each sample.
The second stage of the U-Net Cascade receives the segmentations of the
previous step as additional input channels. To prevent strong co-adaptation we
apply random morphological operators (erode, dilate, open, close) and randomly
remove connected components of these segmentations.
Patch Sampling To increase the stability of our network training we enforce
that more than a third of the samples in a batch contain at least one randomly
chosen foreground class.
2.4 Inference
Due to the patch-based nature of our training, all inference is done patch-based
as well. Since network accuracy decreases towards the border of patches, we
weigh voxels close to the center higher than those close to the border, when
aggregating predictions across patches. Patches are chosen to overlap by patch
size / 2 and we further make use of test time data augmentation by mirroring
all patches along all valid axes.
Combining the tiled prediction and test time data augmentation result in
segmentations where the decision for each voxel is obtained by aggregating up
to 64 predictions (in the center of a patient using 3D U-Net). For the test cases
we use the five networks obtained from our training set cross-validation as an
ensemble to further increase the robustness of our models.
2.5 Postprocessing
A connected component analysis of all ground truth segmentation labels is performed on the training data. If a class lies within a single connected component
in all cases, this behaviour is interepreted as a general property of the dataset.
Hence, all but the largest connected component for this class are automatically
removed on predicted images of the corresponding dataset.
2.6 Ensembling and Submission
To further increase the segmentation performance and robustness all possible
combinations of two out of three of our models are ensembled for each dataset.
For the final submission, the model (or ensemble) that achieves the highest mean
foreground dice score on the training set cross-validation is automatically chosen.
3 Experiments and Results
We optimize our network topologie using five-fold cross-validations on the phase
1 datasets. Our phase 1 cross-validation results as well as the corresponding
submitted test set results are summarized in Table 2. - indicates that the U-Net
Cascade was not applicable (i.e. necessary, according to our criteria) to a dataset
because it was already fully covered by the input patch size of the 3D U-Net. The
model that was used for the final submission is highlighted in bold. Although
several test set submissions were allowed by the platform, we believe it to be
bad practice to do so. Hence we only submitted once and report the results of
this single submission.
As can be seen in Table 2 our phase 1 cross-validation results are robustly
recovered on the held-out test set indicating a desired absence of over-fitting.
The only dataset that suffers from a dip in performance on all of its foreground
classes is BrainTumour. The data of this phase 1 dataset stems from the BRATS
challenge [16] for which such performance drops between validation and testing
are a common sight and attributed to a large shift in the respective data and/or
ground-truth distributions.
4 Discussion
In this paper we present the nnU-Net segmentation framework for the medical domain that directly builds around the original U-Net architecture [6] and
dynamically adapts itself to the specifics of any given dataset. Based on our hypothesis that non-architectural modifications can be much more powerful than

some of the recently presented architectural modifications, the essence of this
framework is a thorough design of adaptive preprocessing, training scheme and
inference. All design choices required to adapt to a new segmentation task are
done in a fully automatic manner with no manual interaction. For each task
the nnU-Net automatically runs a five-fold cross-validation for three different
automatically configures U-Net models and the model (or ensemble) with the
highest mean foreground dice score is chosen for final submission. In the context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon we demonstrate that the nnU-Net
performs competitively on the held-out test sets of 7 highly distinct medical
datasets, achieving the highest mean dice scores for all classes of all tasks (except class 1 in the BrainTumour dataset) on the online leaderboard at the time of
manuscript submission. We acknowledge that training three models and picking
the best one for each dataset independently is not the cleanest solution. Given
a larger time-scale, one could investigate proper heuristics to identify the best
model for a given dataset prior to training. Our current tendency favors the
U-Net Cascade (or the 3D U-Net if the cascade cannot be applied) with the sole
(close) exceptions being the Prostate and Liver tasks. Additionally, the added
benefit of many of our design choices, such as the use of Leaky ReLUs instead of
regular ReLUs and the parameters of our data augmentation were not properly
validated in the context of this challenge. Future work will therefore focus on
systematically evaluating all design choices via ablation studies.
