    '''
    Downsamples each sample (linearly) by a random factor and upsamples to original resolution again (nearest neighbor)

    Info:
    * Uses scipy zoom for resampling. A bit faster than nilearn.
    * Resamples all dimensions (channels, x, y, z) with same downsampling factor (like isotropic=True from
    linear_downsampling_generator_nilearn)

    Args:
        zoom_range: can be either tuple/list/np.ndarray or tuple of tuple. If tuple/list/np.ndarray, then the zoom
        factor will be sampled from zoom_range[0], zoom_range[1] (zoom < 0 = downsampling!). If tuple of tuple then
        each inner tuple will give a sampling interval for each axis (allows for different range of zoom values for
        each axis

        p_per_channel: probability for downsampling/upsampling a channel

        per_channel (bool): whether to draw a new zoom_factor for each channel or keep one for all channels

        channels (list, tuple): if None then all channels can be augmented. If list then only the channel indices can
        be augmented (but may not always be depending on p_per_channel)
